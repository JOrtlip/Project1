I honestly couldn't make heads or tails of most of the available code, and my computer bricked halfway through.  What you have here, is a quick-and-dirty percent-change analysis of the cleaned-up, formatted data I pulled from Matt's 'project.ipynb'.  

I looked exclusively at the average annual percent changes in home sale price and household income, to look for evidence of a growing housing bubble.

My analysis indicates that the average growth per year in income, in Mecklenberg and its surrounding counties, is 5%, while the increase in home sale price in the same area is 8%.  This indicates to me that home prices are beginning to outstrip income increase, and that, long-term, this will indeed cause a potentially dangerous ballooning of price versus purchasing ability.
